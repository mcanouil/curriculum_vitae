	abstract = {In observational cohorts, longitudinal data are collected with repeated measurements at predetermined time points for many biomarkers, along with other variables measured at baseline. In these cohorts, time until a certain event of interest occurs is reported and very often, a relationship will be observed between some biomarker repeatedly measured over time and that event. Joint models were designed to efficiently estimate statistical parameters describing this relationship by combining a mixed model for the longitudinal biomarker trajectory and a survival model for the time until occurrence of the event, using a set of random effects to account for the relationship between the two types of data. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of joint models in genetic association studies. First, we check model consistency based on different simulation scenarios, by varying sample sizes, minor allele frequencies and number of repeated measurements. Second, using genotypes assayed with the Metabochip {DNA} arrays (Illumina) from about 4,500 individuals recruited in the French cohort D.E.S.I.R. ({\textbackslash}textit\{Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance syndrome\}), we assess the feasibility of implementing the joint modelling approach in a real high-throughput genomic dataset. An alternative model approximating the joint model, called the Two-Step approach ({TS}), is also presented. Although the joint model shows more precise and less biased estimators than its alternative counterpart, the {TS} approach results in much reduced computational times, and could thus be used for testing millions of {SNPs} at the genome-wide scale.},

	abstract = {In type 2 diabetes (T2D), hepatic insulin resistance is strongly associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ({NAFLD}). In this study, we hypothesized that {DNA} methylome of livers from patients with T2D, when compared to livers of individuals with normal plasma glucose levels, can unveil some mechanism of hepatic insulin resistance that could link to {NAFLD}. Using {DNA} methylome and transcriptome analyses of livers from obese individuals, we found that both hypomethylation at a {CpG} site in {PDGFA} (encoding platelet derived growth factor alpha) and {PDGFA} overexpression are associated with increased T2D risk, hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin resistance and increased steatohepatitis risk. Both genetic risk score studies and human cell modeling pointed to a causative impact of high insulin levels on {PDGFA} {CpG} site hypomethylation, {PDGFA} overexpression, and increased {PDGF}-{AA} secretion from liver. We found that {PDGF}-{AA} secretion further stimulates its own expression through protein kinase C activity and contributes to insulin resistance through decreased expression of both insulin receptor substrate 1 and of insulin receptor. Importantly, hepatocyte insulin sensitivity can be restored by {PDGF}-{AA} blocking antibodies, {PDGF} receptor inhibitors and by metformin opening therapeutic avenues. Therefore, in the liver of obese patients with T2D, the increased {PDGF}-{AA} signaling contributes to insulin resistance, opening new therapeutic avenues against T2D and possibly {NAFLD}.},

We make two important observations. First, only five of these signals are driven by low-frequency variants: even for these, effect sizes are modest (odds ratio ≤1.29). Second, when we used large-scale genome-wide association data to fine-map the associated variants in their regional context, accounting for the global enrichment of complex trait associations in coding sequence, compelling evidence for coding variant causality was obtained for only 16 signals. At 13 others, the associated coding variants clearly represent 'false leads' with potential to generate erroneous mechanistic inference. Coding variant associations offer a direct route to biological insight for complex diseases and identification of validated therapeutic targets; however, appropriate mechanistic inference requires careful specification of their causal contribution to disease predisposition.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association analysis advanced understanding of blood pressure ({BP}), a major risk factor for vascular conditions such as coronary heart disease and stroke. Accounting for smoking behavior may help identify {BP} loci and extend our knowledge of its genetic architecture. We performed genome-wide association meta-analyses of systolic and diastolic {BP} incorporating gene-smoking interactions in 610,091 individuals. Stage 1 analysis examined ∼18.8 million {SNPs} and small insertion/deletion variants in 129,913 individuals from four ancestries (European, African, Asian, and Hispanic) with follow-up analysis of promising variants in 480,178 additional individuals from five ancestries. We identified 15 loci that were genome-wide significant (p {\textless} 5 × 10-8) in stage 1 and formally replicated in stage 2. A combined stage 1 and 2 meta-analysis identified 66 additional genome-wide significant loci (13, 35, and 18 loci in European, African, and trans-ancestry, respectively). A total of 56 known {BP} loci were also identified by our results (p {\textless} 5 × 10-8). Of the newly identified loci, ten showed significant interaction with smoking status, but none of them were replicated in stage 2. Several loci were identified in African ancestry, highlighting the importance of genetic studies in diverse populations. The identified loci show strong evidence for regulatory features and support shared pathophysiology with cardiometabolic and addiction traits. They also highlight a role in {BP} regulation for biological candidates such as modulators of vascular structure and function ({CDKN}1B, {BCAR}1-{CFDP}1, {PXDN}, {EEA}1), ciliopathies ({SDCCAG}8, {RPGRIP}1L), telomere maintenance ({TNKS}, {PINX}1, {AKTIP}), and central dopaminergic signaling ({MSRA}, {EBF}2).},

	abstract = {Hepatic {DPP}4 expression is elevated in subjects with ectopic fat accumulation in the liver. However, whether increased dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ({DPP}4) is involved in the pathogenesis or is rather a consequence of metabolic disease is not known. We therefore studied the transcriptional regulation of hepatic Dpp4 in young mice prone to diet-induced obesity. Already at 6 weeks of age, expression of hepatic Dpp4 was increased in mice with high weight gain, independent of liver fat content. In the same animals, methylation of four intronic {CpG} sites was decreased, amplifying glucose-induced transcription of hepatic Dpp4 In older mice, hepatic triglyceride content was increased only in animals with elevated Dpp4 expression. Expression and release of {DPP}4 were markedly higher in the liver compared with adipose depots. Analysis of human liver biopsy specimens revealed a correlation of {DPP}4 expression and {DNA} methylation to stages of hepatosteatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. In summary, our results indicate a crucial role of the liver in participation to systemic {DPP}4 levels. Furthermore, the data show that glucose-induced expression of Dpp4 in the liver is facilitated by demethylation of the Dpp4 gene early in life. This might contribute to early deteriorations in hepatic function, which in turn result in metabolic disease such as hepatosteatosis later in life.},

	abstract = {Genetic variants near {ARAP}1 ({CENTD}2) and {STARD}10 influence type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. The risk alleles impair glucose-induced insulin secretion and, paradoxically but characteristically, are associated with decreased proinsulin:insulin ratios, indicating improved proinsulin conversion. Neither the identity of the causal variants nor the gene(s) through which risk is conferred have been firmly established. Whereas {ARAP}1 encodes a {GTPase} activating protein, {STARD}10 is a member of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein ({StAR})-related lipid transfer protein family. By integrating genetic fine-mapping and epigenomic annotation data and performing promoter-reporter and chromatin conformational capture (3C) studies in β cell lines, we localize the causal variant(s) at this locus to a 5 kb region that overlaps a stretch-enhancer active in islets. This region contains several highly correlated T2D-risk variants, including the rs140130268 indel. Expression {QTL} analysis of islet transcriptomes from three independent subject groups demonstrated that T2D-risk allele carriers displayed reduced levels of {STARD}10 {mRNA}, with no concomitant change in {ARAP}1 {mRNA} levels. Correspondingly, β-cell-selective deletion of {StarD}10 in mice led to impaired glucose-stimulated Ca2+ dynamics and insulin secretion and recapitulated the pattern of improved proinsulin processing observed at the human {GWAS} signal. Conversely, overexpression of {StarD}10 in the adult β cell improved glucose tolerance in high fat-fed animals. In contrast, manipulation of Arap1 in β cells had no impact on insulin secretion or proinsulin conversion in mice. This convergence of human and murine data provides compelling evidence that the T2D risk associated with variation at this locus is mediated through reduction in {STARD}10 expression in the β cell.},

Copy number of {AMY}1A (encoding {AMY}1) was reported to be higher in populations with a high-starch diet and reduced in obese people. These results based on quantitative {PCR} have been challenged recently. We aimed to re-assess the relationship between amylase and adiposity using a systems biology approach.
{METHODS}: We assessed the association between plasma enzymatic activity of {AMY}1 or {AMY}2, and several metabolic traits in almost 4000 French individuals from D.E.S.I.R. longitudinal study. The effect of the number of copies of {AMY}1A (encoding {AMY}1) or {AMY}2A (encoding {AMY}2) measured through droplet digital {PCR} was then analyzed on the same parameters in the same study. A Mendelian randomization analysis was also performed. We subsequently assessed the association between {AMY}1A copy number and obesity risk in two case-control studies (5000 samples in total). Finally, we assessed the association between body mass index ({BMI})-related plasma metabolites and {AMY}1 or {AMY}2 activity.
{RESULTS}: We evidenced strong associations between {AMY}1 or {AMY}2 activity and lower {BMI}. However, we found a modest contribution of {AMY}1A copy number to lower {BMI}. Mendelian randomization identified a causal negative effect of {BMI} on {AMY}1 and {AMY}2 activities. Yet, we also found a significant negative contribution of {AMY}1 activity at baseline to the change in {BMI} during the 9-year follow-up, and a significant contribution of {AMY}1A copy number to lower obesity risk in children, suggesting a bidirectional relationship between {AMY}1 activity and adiposity. Metabonomics identified a {BMI}-independent association between {AMY}1 activity and lactate, a product of complex carbohydrate fermentation.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These findings provide new insights into the involvement of amylase in adiposity and starch metabolism.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) have identified {\textgreater}100 loci independently contributing to type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk. However, translational implications for precision medicine and for the development of novel treatments have been disappointing, due to poor knowledge of how these loci impact T2D pathophysiology. Here, we aimed to measure the expression of genes located nearby T2D associated signals and to assess their effect on insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells.
{METHODS}: The expression of 104 candidate T2D susceptibility genes was measured in a human multi-tissue panel, through {PCR}-free expression assay. The effects of the knockdown of beta-cell enriched genes were next investigated on insulin secretion from the human {EndoC}-βH1 beta-cell line. Finally, we performed {RNA}-sequencing ({RNA}-seq) so as to assess the pathways affected by the knockdown of the new genes impacting insulin secretion from {EndoC}-βH1, and we analyzed the expression of the new genes in mouse models with altered pancreatic beta-cell function.
{RESULTS}: We found that the candidate T2D susceptibility genes' expression is significantly enriched in pancreatic beta cells obtained by laser capture microdissection or sorted by flow cytometry and in {EndoC}-βH1 cells, but not in insulin sensitive tissues. Furthermore, the knockdown of seven T2D-susceptibility genes ({CDKN}2A, {GCK}, {HNF}4A, {KCNK}16, {SLC}30A8, {TBC}1D4, and {TCF}19) with already known expression and/or function in beta cells changed insulin secretion, supporting our functional approach. We showed first evidence for a role in insulin secretion of four candidate T2D-susceptibility genes ({PRC}1, {SRR}, {ZFAND}3, and {ZFAND}6) with no previous knowledge of presence and function in beta cells. {RNA}-seq in {EndoC}-βH1 cells with decreased expression of {PRC}1, {SRR}, {ZFAND}6, or {ZFAND}3 identified specific gene networks related to T2D pathophysiology. Finally, a positive correlation between the expression of Ins2 and the expression of Prc1, Srr, Zfand6, and Zfand3 was found in mouse pancreatic islets with altered beta-cell function.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This study showed the ability of post-{GWAS} functional studies to identify new genes and pathways involved in human pancreatic beta-cell function and in T2D pathophysiology.},

Although bisphenols F ({BPF}) and S ({BPS}) are {BPA} structural analogs commonly used in many marketed products as a replacement for {BPA}, only sparse toxicological data are available yet. Our objective was to comprehensively characterize bisphenols gene targets in a human primary adipocyte model, in order to determine whether they may induce cellular dysfunction, using chronic exposure at two concentrations: a "low-dose" similar to the dose usually encountered in human biological fluids and a higher dose. Therefore, {BPA}, {BPF} and {BPS} have been added at 10 {nM} or 10 μM during the differentiation of human primary adipocytes from subcutaneous fat of three non-diabetic Caucasian female patients. Gene expression ({mRNA}/{lncRNA}) arrays and {microRNA} arrays, have been used to assess coding and non-coding {RNA} changes. We detected significantly deregulated {mRNA}/{lncRNA} and {miRNA} at low and high doses. Enrichment in "cancer" and "organismal injury and abnormalities" related pathways was found in response to the three products. Some long intergenic non-coding {RNAs} and small nucleolar {RNAs} were differentially expressed suggesting that bisphenols may also activate multiple cellular processes and epigenetic modifications. The analysis of upstream regulators of deregulated genes highlighted hormones or hormone-like chemicals suggesting that {BPS} and {BPF} can be suspected to interfere, just like {BPA}, with hormonal regulation and have to be considered as endocrine disruptors. All these results suggest that as {BPA}, its substitutes {BPS} and {BPF} should be used with the same restrictions.},

	abstract = {Heavy alcohol consumption is an established risk factor for hypertension; the mechanism by which alcohol consumption impact blood pressure ({BP}) regulation remains unknown. We hypothesized that a genome-wide association study accounting for gene-alcohol consumption interaction for {BP} might identify additional {BP} loci and contribute to the understanding of alcohol-related {BP} regulation. We conducted a large two-stage investigation incorporating joint testing of main genetic effects and single nucleotide variant ({SNV})-alcohol consumption interactions. In Stage 1, genome-wide discovery meta-analyses in ≈131K individuals across several ancestry groups yielded 3,514 {SNVs} (245 loci) with suggestive evidence of association (P {\textless} 1.0 x 10−5). In Stage 2, these {SNVs} were tested for independent external replication in ≈440K individuals across multiple ancestries. We identified and replicated (at Bonferroni correction threshold) five novel {BP} loci (380 {SNVs} in 21 genes) and 49 previously reported {BP} loci (2,159 {SNVs} in 109 genes) in European ancestry, and in multi-ancestry meta-analyses (P {\textless} 5.0 x 10−8). For African ancestry samples, we detected 18 potentially novel {BP} loci (P {\textless} 5.0 x 10−8) in Stage 1 that warrant further replication. Additionally, correlated meta-analysis identified eight novel {BP} loci (11 genes). Several genes in these loci (e.g., {PINX}1, {GATA}4, {BLK}, {FTO} and {GABBR}2) have been previously reported to be associated with alcohol consumption. These findings provide insights into the role of alcohol consumption in the genetic architecture of hypertension.},

	abstract = {Melatonin meets diabetes
Some of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) occur in the gene encoding the melatonin receptor {MT}2, a G protein–coupled receptor ({GPCR}). Karamitri et al. measured the spontaneous and melatonin-stimulated signaling of 40 different {MT}2 variants. Computational analysis of these signaling profiles and assessment of genetic association data showed that those {MT}2 variants with defective melatonin-stimulated G protein signaling and reduced spontaneous β-arrestin recruitment were associated with the greatest risk for T2D. These data may aid in the development of specific treatments for T2D depending on the patient’s {MT}2 variant. Moreover, the experimental approach may be applied to assess the impact of other {GPCR} mutations on disease associations.
Melatonin is produced during the night and regulates sleep and circadian rhythms. Loss-of-function variants in {MTNR}1B, which encodes the melatonin receptor {MT}2, a G protein–coupled receptor ({GPCR}), are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To identify specific T2D-associated signaling pathway(s), we profiled the signaling output of 40 {MT}2 variants by monitoring spontaneous (ligand-independent) and melatonin-induced activation of multiple signaling effectors. Genetic association analysis showed that defects in the melatonin-induced activation of Gαi1 and Gαz proteins and in spontaneous β-arrestin2 recruitment to {MT}2 were the most statistically significantly associated with an increased T2D risk. Computational variant impact prediction by in silico evolutionary lineage analysis strongly correlated with the measured phenotypic effect of each variant, providing a predictive tool for future studies on {GPCR} variants. Together, this large-scale functional study provides an operational framework for the postgenomic analysis of the multiple {GPCR} variants present in the human population. The association of T2D risk with signaling pathway–specific defects opens avenues for pathway-specific personalized therapeutic intervention and reveals the potential relevance of {MT}2 function during the day, when melatonin is undetectable, but spontaneous activity of the receptor occurs.
Connecting melatonin receptor variants to signaling differences reveals paths to type 2 diabetes therapy.
